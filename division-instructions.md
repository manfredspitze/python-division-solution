## Python: Division Operator

### Getting Started

- Create a GitHub repo named: **python-division**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - No need to share your repo with your teacher
    - Teacher will discuss your work with you during Teacher  Time

- Create a NEW folder on your workstation desktop
- Use VS Code to add your Python file to this new folder


### Objective

> *In this practice project, you'll learn how to use the Python division (/) operator.*


### Comments, anyone?

- Add a comment block (*Python Division Practice* as your project name)
- Add a few brief comments to explain what the main parts of your script are doing

### Your Tasks

- Use comments to label each task in your script
  - Example: # Part 1, # Part 2, etc.
- Use f-strings to display the output for each task

#### Task 1

- Assign integers to two variables
- Define a third variable to store the result of the calculation
- Use the division operator (/) to tell Python to divide the first number by the second number
- Display both numbers and the result in your f-string

#### Task 2

- Define two variables and assign a float to each
- Define a third variable to store the result of the calculation
- Use the division operator (/) to tell Python to divide the first float by the second float
- Use an f-string to display both numbers and the result of the calculation

#### Task 3

- Prompt the user to enter two floats
- Define a variable and write the formula that tells Python to divide the first number the user entered by the second
- Use the division operator (/) to do this
- Display both numbers and the result in an f-string

#### Task 4

- Define three variables (such as `num1`, `num2` and `num3`)
- Either assign numbers to each variable or prompt the user to enter three numbers
- Define a third variable named `number_count` and assign it the number of numbers you're working with in this problem
- Use a set of parentheses ( ) and the division operator (/) to calculate the average of your three numbers
- Use an f-string to display all three numbers and the average of the three numbers

#### Task 5

- Calculate the unit cost of an item you bought at the grocery store
- To do this, you'll need to define three variables:
  - `total_cost`
  - `quantity`
  - `unit_price` (which will store a calculated value)
- Use an f-string to display a sentence that says what the (calculated) unit price for the grocery item is

#### Task 6

- Calculate your grade percentage for a recent quiz you took in Chemistry
- The quiz was worth a total of 100 points
- You earned 85 points on the quiz
- Calculate and display your grade percentage for the quiz
- Use an f-string to display your grade percentage to two places after the decimal point
- Include the '%' symbol in your output string
